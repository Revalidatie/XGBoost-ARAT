  <h3>Welcome to the XGBoost ARAT prediction tool</h3>
  Welcome to web application developed to showcase an XGBoost prediction model of upper limb recovery of stroke patients. The app makes a prediction of the ARAT score at 6 months of an individual patient based on clinical data that you input.
  
  <br /><br /><em>This tool is currently a research tool and not yet suitable for clinical use.</em>
  
  <h4>Steps to get a prediction</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Upload patient data</b></li>
    Predictions can be retrieved by uploading a file with comma-separated patient data in the panel on the left. This file should contain one or multiple measurements of ARAT, shoulder abduction, finger extension and the corresponding time of measurement of a single patient. A detailed description of the input variables is given below. You can download example patient files in the left panel.
    <li><b>Choose moment of model application</b></li>
    After uploading is complete, a slider will appear that lets you select the moment in time from which you want to make the predictions. For example, if you choose 7 days post stroke, the model will predict as if it was applied at that time, with only the measurements that were taken in the first week. 
    <li><b>View prediction</b></li>
    Predictions for your patient can be viewed in the tab <i>View prediction</i>. The prediction output will dynamically change when you select different time points with the slider.
  </ol>
